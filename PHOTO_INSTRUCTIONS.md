## How to Add Your Photo

1. **Get your photo ready**:
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Size: 400x400 pixels or larger (recommended)
   - Make sure it's a good quality photo

2. **Add to your portfolio folder**:
   - Save your photo as `profile.jpg` 
   - Put it in the same folder as `index.html`
   - Make sure the filename is exactly `profile.jpg` (lowercase)

3. **What will happen**:
   - Your photo will appear in the profile section (circular)
   - Your photo will also appear as a background in the hero section
   - The background will have a dark overlay so text remains readable
